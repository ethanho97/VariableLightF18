# VariableLightF18

## About

This project is meant to train our design skills by working out the entire design process for making a variable LED. By the end of the Fal 2018 semester, we will have made a variable LED light with the following basic functionalities and constraints:
#### Functions:
* Switches between different operation modes using a button
* Self-contained device
#### Constraints:
* Uses single battery up to 9V
* Uses single PCB
* Weighs < 1 lb
* Single dimension < 6 in
* Costs < $50
* Replaceable battery

As well as potential extra functionality. The criteria we will be judged on for our design are:
* Minimize weight
* Minimize size
* Maximize `Brightest` mode
* Minimize power draw / maximize battery life
* Survive 3 foot drop with battery installed

This project will have us work individually to come up with our own design and planning process which will be maintained via this repository.
