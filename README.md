# VariableLightF18

## About

This project is meant to train our design skills by working out the entire design process for making a variable LED. By the end of the Fal 2018 semester, we will have made a variable LED light with the following basic functionalities and constraints: 
* Switches between different operation modes using a button
* Self-contained device
* Uses single battery up to 9V
* Uses single PCB
* Weighs < 1 lb
* Single dimension < 6 in
* Costs < $50
* Replaceable battery
As well as potential extra functionality.
This project will have us work individually to come up with our own design and planning process which will be maintained via this repository.
